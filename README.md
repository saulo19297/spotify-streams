## Project
analyze the data on the most streamed songs in 2023 to find insights into why some songs have more streams than others.

## Data Analysis
- check columns
- select the columns that I wanted to analyze
- Remove songs with less than 1 million streams

## Visualization

- Bottom 10 least streams artist and Danceability pct
- Top 10 stream artist and Energy pct
- Bottom 10 least stream artist and Energy pct
- Total artist's songs

## Recomendations
- Artist should released more songs per year, because more streamed artists in 2023 are the artist who realeased the most songs
- Danceability and energy should be between 50 to 70
